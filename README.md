Immersive Drone Flight Simulation

Project Overview

An interactive drone flight simulation built in Unity using Cesium for Unity. The project enables users to control a drone and explore real-world global locations with real-time geospatial data (satellite imagery, terrain elevation, and 3D buildings).

Features:
Real-time 3D geospatial rendering with Cesium for Unity.
Fly to any location on Earth using latitude, longitude, and height.
Adjustable drone controls (movement speed, rotation, altitude).
Multiple camera views: Third-Person, Birdâ€™s-Eye and Top-Down.
